function [c, ceq ] = con_func( x, box1_springs, box2_springs )

% the constraint function. 
% This constraint is statisfied if ceq = 0
% The function takes in a vector (x) that contains the displacement of the
% ends of all springs, and the uncompressed spring shape data (box1_springs
% and box2_springs)


% The function perform SAT test on every pair of springs.
% If two springs intersect, SAT will return the magnitude(norm) of the MTLD
% the sum of the magnitude of MTLD will be returned as ceq.
% If they do not intersect, SAT will return zero.
% since there is no inequality constraint, c is returned as an empty vector.

% Modify the height of the shape based on the displacement of the spring
